This is a place to practice git. Your first exercise is to add your name to this list.  
To do so first go through the [curated list of git resource](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/) provided by github and learn to use git. 
Then fork the respository, create a new branch and add your name and send a pull request.  
Your entry should maintain the alphabetic order and it should be in the format ```your name <email-id>```
